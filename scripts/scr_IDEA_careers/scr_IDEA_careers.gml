Interest System?

music
business
crafting


Career system that uses the interest system to determine who will do what. Maybe if there isnt someone that is of a certain interest level, the career in that town will not be filled. 

Possible Careers
-smith
-innkeep
-cook
-soldier
-hunter



there could be some careers that are a lot more common and therefore will likely be in most towns, but what if there was some careers that were really rare and it wasnt even guarenteed that they would be in the game?

these careers could either be based on stand alone interests or by a very high level of interest in a particular topic.

FOR example,

a taxidermist could be an extreme level of hunter interest, all the other hunters would likely go to them to use thier services. this could help create a social system based on common interests. 
So there are a lot of hunters that love it but they dont have the skill or interest in taxidermying the animals themselves, so they go to a person who has that skill.....

Maybe NPCs could mention it to you.

like if you ran into a hunter they might say they heard there was a taxidermist in some village down the way.


IDEA- Perhaps based on the wealth factor of an area/city, it will open up certain career options
each individual could have thier own wealth factor that could determine what they do
